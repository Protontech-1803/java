# Converting XML Object to JSON Object using Java Programming
This POC illustrates how to convert an XML Object to JSON Object using a POJO with Java Programming. 

The following are the steps to create a POJO for XML to JSON Conversion and executing the same.

1.	Using an IDE or any editor, create a Java Program file named “XML_to_JSON.java”.

2.	Copy the below code to the file “XML_to_JSON.java”.
 
3.	The Java Class XMLtoJSONConvert defined in the code contains the main() method which Converts the input XML String object to JSON using the method XML.toJSONObject() defined in the org.json package.

4.	The Sample Input XML is defined as a String Object named XML_Input_Object, which contains the sample XML as shown in the code.
5.	To display the JSON object, it is converted into string and printed using System.out.println() method.
6.	Compile the POJO using javac compiler as shown below.

7.	Run the XMLtoJSONConvert Class using the below command.

8.	On execution, the below JSON object will be displayed.
